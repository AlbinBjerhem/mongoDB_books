# Manual & Automatic Test 1: Authors

## Test Cases

## Manual
"Verify that the API returns the correct HTTP status code (e.g., 200 OK) for a successful GET request."

## Automatic
"Validate that the API returns the correct HTTP status code (e.g., 200 OK) for a successful GET request."

## Motivation
This test validates that the API properly handles GET requests for author information. Ensuring a `200 OK` status code confirms the request's success and the accurate retrieval of data.
This test is straightforward and doesn't require both automatic and manual testing. Automated testing can efficiently verify the HTTP status code, and manual testing isn't needed for such a simple check. If you want to run it manual you can just press send on the GET request and you will see the results.

## Test Steps
1. Send a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/api/authors`.
2. Expect status code: `200 OK`.

## Expected Results
- The response status code should be `200 OK`.

## Actual Test Results for Authors Endpoint
- **Status Code**: `200 OK`
- **Response Time**: `17 ms`
- **Response Body**: As expected. Below is a snippet of the JSON response:
  ```json
  {
      "_id": "6624f696211bb9bad5be0ce1",
      "authorId": 1,
      "firstName": "Quintin",
      "lastName": "Ganforthe",
      "__v": 0
  }
- **Test Result**: Test Passed: Response status code is 200

# Manual Testing 10: Authors

## Test Case
"Test the APIâs performance under heavy load, simulating a large number of users making requests simultaneously."

## Test Steps
1. **POST Create Authors**: 
   - Send POST requests to `/api/authors` to create new author entries.
     - Expect status code: 201 Created.
     - Verify that the response contains an author ID.
     - Save the IDs in environment variables for deletion tests.
   - Repeat these steps for 10 iterations.

2. **DELETE Authors**: 
   - Use the IDs saved from the POST requests to send DELETE requests to `/api/authors/{authorId}`.
     - Expect status code: 200 OK or 204 No Content.
     - Verify that the response message indicates successful deletion.
   - Repeat these steps for 10 iterations.

## Expected Results
- POST requests should successfully create authors and return a 201 Created status along with an author ID, across 10 iterations.
- DELETE requests should successfully remove authors and return either a 200 OK or 204 No Content status, across 10 iterations.
- The server should be able to handle all this data.

### Actual Test Results
- **Status Codes**: `201 Created`, `200 OK`
- **Response Time**: Average `30 ms`
